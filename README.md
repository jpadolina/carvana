This is a group project done on webscraping BMW listings from Carvana.com and analyzing the dataset to predict prices. My contribution to the code consisted of the large "Big Scrape" code chunk, the variable count check, and the test block for testing individual features.

## Objective
To scrape multiple pages of listings into one centralized SQL table. The table contains 1 listing per row, including the model, year, physical features, mileage, number of imperfections, likes, saves, and other features.

## Parameters
Make: BMW
Scrape date range: mid-March 2021
ZIP code: 94103
